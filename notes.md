# Requirements

Below are the requirements for the tech assignment that I had mentioned, I just need you to build a sign-up flow with React/Redux (with NodeJS, express, and a Database of your choice for the backend). Below are the requirements, feel free to get this sent back to me within the next 48 hours (you can submit using Github or simply send a Zip Folder).

Setup React/React Router and create 3 pages

- Landing Page
- Verification Page
- Confirmation Page

LANDING PAGE will have a sign-up form consisting of the following fields:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Username
- Email
- Password
- Confirm Password

VERIFICATION PAGE will display the user's information and two options:

CORRECT INFORMATION
CONFIRM

If a user confirms that the information is correct, save the information to a database (via a NodeJS endpoint) and then take them to a simple confirmation page.

If a user clicks on 'correct the information' it will take them back to the home page, displaying the information already entered.

CONFIRMATION PAGE (Just a simple confirmation page... nothing fancy).

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach back out.
